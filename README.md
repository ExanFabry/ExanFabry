### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on an exciting project where I'm building a complete website from the ground up for my own band. This project allows me to combine my passion for music with my technical skills. The website is being developed using HTML (EJS) for templating, CSS for styling, TypeScript for adding robust functionality, and MySQL to manage and store the backend data.
  
- ðŸ”­ Besides that I am currently developing my own webapplication about bands for a schoolproject.
  
- ðŸ”­ I am also doing a groupproject at school in which we are creating a lord of the rings quiz webapplication.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently diving deep into a multifaceted learning journey at college. My focus spans a diverse range of subjects including Scrum/Agile methodologies, C# programming with an emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), TypeScript for front and backend development, mastering Git for version control, navigating Azure for cloud computing, testing to make my projects fully functional, cybersecurity to make my projects as safe as possible, and unraveling the complexities of networks. It's an exciting blend of theory and hands-on practice, shaping me into a well-rounded developer.
  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ethical hacking and C#.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C# and SQL.

- âš¡ Beyond my coding adventures, I find solace and joy in three other passions: creating music, lift heavy weights in the gym and delving into the world of Magic: The Gathering.
