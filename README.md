### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently working on an exciting project where I'm building a complete website from the ground up for my own band. This project allows me to combine my passion for music with my technical skills. The website is being developed using HTML (EJS) for templating, CSS for styling, TypeScript for adding robust functionality, and MySQL to manage and store the backend data.

- 🌱 I'm currently diving deep into a multifaceted learning journey at college. My focus spans a diverse range of subjects including Scrum/Agile methodologies, C# programming with an emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), TypeScript for front and backend development, mastering Git for version control, navigating Azure for cloud computing, testing to make my projects fully functional, cybersecurity to make my projects as safe as possible, and unraveling the complexities of networks. It's an exciting blend of theory and hands-on practice, shaping me into a well-rounded technologist.

- ⚡ Beyond my coding adventures, I find solace and joy in two other passions: making music and delving into the world of Magic: The Gathering.
