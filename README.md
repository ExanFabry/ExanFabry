### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a groupsproject at school where we create a magic the gathering website. You can find the repostitory pinned at my github. I am also working on a console application in c# where I create a library application. I am working on a fake website where I sell magic the gathering cards created with typescript and an API I created myself which is also pinned at my github.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to work with scrum/agile, c# OOP, typescript, nodeJS, git and networks at school.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving my c# skills.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Besides developping I also love playing music and playing magic the gathering.
